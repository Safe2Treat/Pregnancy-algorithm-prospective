													02 - MACROS FOR TOO LONG PREGNANCIES

Some pregnancies were identified as having too long of a gestational length. These have to be revised so that they are not too long.
This only occurred to pregnancies with UNK outcomes.

********************************************************************************************************************************************/

/*
MACRO: revise_too_long
PURPOSE: The goal of this macro is to revise date-based information for those pregnancies
that are identified as being too long.

The process should look as follow:
1. Subset to those pregnancies with UNK outcomes with a gestational length gt 307d
2. For those without any GA codes, reassign their LMP by assuming that they were 4w0d
	gestation at their indexing prenatal encounter.
3. Reapply the gestational age algorithm but assume the minimum GA for the
	gestational age in days. Ignore prenatal care codes. For any min GAs of 14, reset
	those to 28
	- Those that no longer have GA information  (i.e., only GA codes were prenatal care),
	reassign their LMP by assuming they were 4w0d gestation at their indexing prenatal enc.
4. For those pregnancies that continue to be too long, assign their LMP as the latest LMP 
	calculated by the algorithm.
5. For those pregnancies that continue to be too long:
	- If they do not have a Z3A cde, assign their LMP by assumign the GA at their indexing
	prenatal encounter was 4w0d
	- If they have a Z3A code, revise the index and LTFU dates. Grab all prenatal encounters that 
	occur between the maximum LMP (from the algorithm using the minimum gestational age) and 307 
	days gestation. Reassign the index date and LTFU accordingly.

INPUTS:
- INPUT_DATA -- Input dataset of pregnancies from the CDW-H algorithm
- OUTPUT_DATA -- Name of the output dataset 
- LMPINDEX -- The gesational age that we assume at the indexing prenatal encounter for UNK pregnancies without GA codes
- DAYS -- The gestational length (in days) that we have determined in too long.
- Round -- The round that we are looping over - important for overlapping pregnancies.
- lmpindex - assumed gestational age at the indexing prenatal encounter
